natural numbers: counting numbers (starting from 1)
transpose: transpose[j][i] = a[i][j]
structure: semi-colon at end while creating its layout
primeNumbers: 0 and 1 are non-prime numbers
                if (n % i == 0):
                if (i % j == 0):
                    not primeNumbers, flag = 1
                flag = 0 for primeNumbers (i%j != 0)

Taking input: address operator needed for %c, not needed for %s
