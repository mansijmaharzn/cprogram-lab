natural numbers: counting numbers (starting from 1)
transpose: transpose[j][i] = a[i][j]
structure: semi-colon at end while creating its layout
primeNumbers: 0 and 1 are non-prime numbers
                if (n % i == 0):
                if (i % j == 0):
                    not primeNumbers, flag = 1
                flag = 0 for primeNumbers (i%j != 0)

Sum of digits of a number:
    t = num;
    while (t != 0) {
        remainder = t % 10;
        sum += remainder;
        t = t / 10;
    } // print(sum);

Check Palindrome:
    original = n;
    while (n != 0) {
        remainder = num % 10;
        reversed = reversed * 10 + remainder;
        num /= 10; // (num = num / 10)
    } // original == reverse: is Palindrome
